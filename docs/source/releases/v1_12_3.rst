Bug Fixes
=========

A few pixels difference in AHI test output
------------------------------------------

After updating the AHI test output, there were still a few pixels difference.
Not sure what caused it.

Update AHI geocolor output for slightly increased coverage
----------------------------------------------------------

GEOIPS/geoips#479 AHI geolocation masking update caused slightly increased
coverage.  60.08 to 60.21% coverage

  renamed:    tests/outputs/ahi_himawari/GeoColor_image/20200405.000000.himawari-8.ahi.GeoColor.himawari.60p08.jma.10p0.png -> tests/outputs/ahi_himawari/GeoColor_image/20200405.000000.himawari-8.ahi.GeoColor.himawari.60p21.jma.10p0.png


Copy lats, lwir, and sunzen arrays before normalizing
-----------------------------------------------------

As we began re-using interpolated arrays for downstream processing to improve
efficiency, noticed geocolor was changing the sun zenith array within the
original xarray object.  To allow re-using interpolated arrays with other
products, ensure GeoColor does not change any arrays.

lats and lwir variables also get normalized, and while in the example case they
did not change (due to being within range), copied those values as well for
completeness.
